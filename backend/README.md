For testing this API you can download Postman or another such an analogue. There are test data that you can use.
Thereâ€™s one user already registered with ADMIN role (login = "admin", password = "1234") and one user with USER role (login = "user", password = "1234"). All new users automatically get USER role. You can change these test data in InjectDataController if you want.
All available endpoints you can see on http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. For authorization, you must add a new header, where Authorization is key and Bearer token is value, where token - value that you will get after login query to the system in the response.
